# BuckeyEpartments

This is a MVP concept for a mobile application to help Ohio State students found housing near campus. This app serves as a central location that takes information
from multiple property managers to simplify the apartment search.

### Some features include
* Google Maps integration to visualize where apartments are located compared to user location as well as proximities to campus
* Distance filters to return only relevant apartments in a proximity radius
* Full property management details and pictures as well as external links
